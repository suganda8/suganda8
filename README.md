Tegar Bangun Suganda
------
I'm Backend Developer who live in Indonesia.

Currently, I am doing all work about Backend Development using Laravel, ExpressJS, Flask and Mobile application using Flutter and Kotlin. I do love Artificial Intelligence, Machine & Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing. Beside all of it, I love cats. Not so confident but I'd do my best in anything, typically double-edged perfectionist. I'm little good at algorithm, way of thinking, creative thought.

Here on my ship, I just want to share all things that I know, Earning money is not that hard, sharing your knowledge at no cost is harder than anything else.
