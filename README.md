Knowledge beyond anything
====
Who is he?
------
Tegar Bangun Suganda is an android developer lived in Sidoarjo, Indonesia.

I'm currently working on software house as android developer, backend developer & database analyst. Still learning as much as I can, an amateur android developer who has interest in android development, backend development, data science, machine learning & artificial intelligence technology.

Not so confident but I would do my best in anything, typically double-edged perfectionist. Of course, I love cats, they're cute.
