Tegar Bangun Suganda
------
I'm Backend and Mobile Developer who lives in Indonesia.

Currently, I'm doing works about Backend Development using Laravel, ExpressJS, Flask and Mobile application using Flutter and Kotlin. I love Artificial Intelligence, Machine & Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing. Not so confident but I'd do my best at anything, typically double-edged perfectionist. I'm good at algorithm, way of thinking, creative thought.
