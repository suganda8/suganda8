A sunflower under the rainstorm
====
Who is he?
------
Tegar Bangun Suganda is an android developer lived in Sidoarjo, Indonesia.

I'm currently working on software house as android developer, backend developer & database analyst. Still learning as much as I can, an amateur android developer who has interest in android development, backend development, data science, machine learning & artificial intelligence technology.

Hopefully, I want to share all things that I know, Earning money is not that hard, sharing your knowledge at no cost is harder than anything else. I'm so bad at social relationship. So, I don't care who are you at least you got something by me, I really want to thank you. I'm little good at algorithm, way of thinking, creative thought. 

Not so confident but I'd do my best in anything, typically double-edged perfectionist. Of course, I hate coffee and I love cats, have a problem with that?

That's it, a little sunflower under the rainstorm, would the storm gone and change to the rainbow?
